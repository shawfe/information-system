## Introduction

The necessity of this project stems from statistical research, showcasing that the usage of educational and testing programs across various disciplines not only heightens interest in the respective field but also improves academic performance. This is largely due to the visual manner in which most students better absorb information. This project is designated for students of the Department of Graphic Information Systems studying programming languages like JavaScript and TypeScript, aiming to engage them in the learning process and provide a vivid example of what can be developed with the knowledge acquired in this field.

## Relevance

The relevance of this work is highlighted by the significant role of digitalization in modern education. Information technologies dominate and set the pace for the educational process. Recently, a growing trend in the utilization of web technologies in education has been observed, increasing annually.

## Objectives and Tasks

The primary objective of this master's thesis is to create an information system capable of managing and administering users and content within this system, focused on teaching languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript. The tasks involved in this project include:
- Analyzing existing analogous information systems,
- Assessing existing tools for developing client-server information systems,
- Designing the structure and interfaces of the information system,
- Developing both the client and server parts of the target information system.

## Subject Area Description

While learning programming languages, students may opt for one or multiple learning approaches: reading books, attending courses, or writing programs following instructions. Each approach has its merits and demerits. The developed information system amalgamates reading books and attending courses, positioning itself as an electronic textbook entailing a wealth of theoretical material.

## Problem Statement Analysis

The master's thesis encompasses the development of an information system embodying elements like:
- Authorization,
- Student personal profile,
- Main pages with theoretical material,
- Main pages with practical exercises,
- An administration panel facilitating comprehensive administration of the system.

## Target Audience

The target audience of this system includes students pursuing information technology, with subjects involving the learning of JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as the instructors teaching these subjects.

## Usage Scenarios

Usage scenarios vary depending on the user type - student or instructor.

For students, key usage scenarios are:
- Registration and authentication,
- Going through lecture material,
- Completing practical exercises,
- Viewing personal progress statistics,
- Modifying personal information.

For instructors, the key scenarios are:
- Student registration,
- Administering students and student groups,
- Administering section structures and chapter content,
- Administering practical exercises,
- Viewing student progress statistics.

## Structure Requirements

The target information system should comprise modules such as:
- Authorization module,
- Admin panel,
- Lecture material pages,
- Practical exercise pages,
- Student personal cabinet.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Angular
- Backend: Nest.js
- Database: MongoDB
- UI kit: Angular Material UI
- CMS: Strapi
- Other Packages: ngx-translate, Ace Editor, Quill Editor, and a service for code execution.
